## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r,results='asis'}
data(mtcars)

mtcars2 <-
  dplyr::mutate(mtcars,
                cyl_factor = factor(cyl,
                                    levels = c(6, 4, 8),
                                    labels = paste(c(6, 4, 8), "cylinders")),
                cyl_character = paste(cyl, "cylinders"))
our_summary1 <-
  list("Miles Per Gallon" =
       list("min" = ~ min(mpg),
            "max" = ~ max(mpg),
            "mean (sd)" = ~ qwraps2::mean_sd(mpg)),
       "Displacement" =
       list("min" = ~ min(disp),
            "max" = ~ max(disp),
            "mean (sd)" = ~ qwraps2::mean_sd(disp)),
       "Weight (1000 lbs)" =
       list("min" = ~ min(wt),
            "max" = ~ max(wt),
            "mean (sd)" = ~ qwraps2::mean_sd(wt)),
       "Forward Gears" =
       list("Three" = ~ qwraps2::n_perc0(gear == 3),
            "Four"  = ~ qwraps2::n_perc0(gear == 4),
            "Five"  = ~ qwraps2::n_perc0(gear == 5))
       )

summary_table(mtcars2, our_summary1)
